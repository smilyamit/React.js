# What we will learn
*React Basic: components, event, templates, props & forms
* React Router: route, route parameter, redirects
* Redux- Stores, action and reducer


In React class based component must have one function, let say render() {}
also inside render there is jsx format (js +html) inside return()
note: inside return generally  there must be only one root element (like only one pair div )
* always rememebr ReactDOM (R should be capital, DOM all letter should be capital)

#JSX
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or 
appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.
FOr eg

using JSX
const myelement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));

Without JSX (a bit long, we have to use React.getElement)
const myelement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');
ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));
