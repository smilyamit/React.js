# What we will learn
*React Basic: components, event, templates, props & forms
* React Router: route, route parameter, redirects
* Redux- Stores, action and reducer


In React class based component must have one function, let say render() {}
also inside render there is jsx format (js +html) inside return()
note: inside return generally  there must be only one root element (like only one pair div )
* always rememebr ReactDOM (R should be capital, DOM all letter should be capital)
*https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/default.asp (react basic)

#JSX
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or 
appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.
FOr eg

using JSX
const myelement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));

Without JSX (a bit long, we have to use React.getElement)
const myelement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');
ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));

** Arrow function has special behaviour when it comes around "this" keyword. They bind the value of this whatever 'this' is 
outside the function (in vs code eg state is outside the fun)

Note:
function display(){
 console.log(this); // 'this' will point to the global object
}

display(); 

** state vs prop
=>Props are immutable i.e. once set the props cannot be changed, while State is an observable object that is to be used to
hold data that may change over time and to control the behavior after each change.
=> States can only be used in Class Components while Props don't have this limitation.

#container Component with states vs UI Component without state made by function (v-15)

##Lifecycle of React

#why id is required in making list inside app.js
=>react expects a unique key on every surrounding element that we return inside this map function right here whenwe output 
them to the browser so that can identify each individual item and perform the Dom manipulations
